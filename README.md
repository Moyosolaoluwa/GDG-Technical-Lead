#World Happiness Score Predictor using Python and Streamlit

This project is for the GDG Technical Lead Assessment.  

I used the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset. I cleaned the data (removed duplicates, filled missing values) and saved it as `cleaned_data.csv`. I made some simple plots like happiness score vs GDP, top 10 happiest countries, and a heatmap.  

For the models, I tried Linear Regression and Random Forest. Random Forest worked better, so I saved it as `final_model.pkl`.  

I also built a Streamlit app where you put in GDP, social support, and life expectancy, and it predicts the happiness score.
